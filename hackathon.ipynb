      "Now I'm going back to my normal Southern English accent comma but I am speaking at a much faster pace than I usually would simply to demonstrate that the accuracy doesn't differ when you throw different challenges at the software full stop in fact comma it actually likes it when you speak in a normal manner as it helps the technology to understand the context of different words such as homophones full stop so comma if your reason for not using speech recognition is that you worry about the accuracy with your accent comma well now you have no excuse exclamation mark OK I'll be serious now I promise if you're still with me after that demo then well done because that was just the weirdest idea I've ever had but we move so sorry we do say that the more you use dragon the better the accuracy will be it learns your voice patterns and your dialect and so the more you use it the better understands you of course that equals better accuracy have a good microphone is also really key for good accuracy for example we only recommend microphones or headsets that have noise cancellation capability so am I don't know I was using the Philips speech 1 which is a really great headset and of course has noise cancellation that's all for me today if we speaking in these crazy accents hasn't shown you how good dragons accuracy is they don't know what will be honest but that is always something that you can try and that is a free proof of concept trial which means you can try the software and see it for yourself completely free of charge so there's always not as always though if you have any comments questions theories make sure you drop them in the comments because I'd love to continue talking Dragons with he dies\n"
